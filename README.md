(***Py***thon ***A***nalysis tools for ***TEM*** images of ***S***oot)

------

A python codebase to analyze TEM images of soot, which includes new methods associated with this project and a compilation of other pre-existing methods into a single Python package. 

This is a port of previous MATLAB code (https://github.com/tsipkens/atems) and remains experimental, in particular in terms of the primary particle sizing methods. 

## dm3_lib

A snapshot of the dm3_lib (https://github.com/nanobore/dm3) for reading in DM3 files is included in this program, and represents a Python adaptation of an original ImageJ plugin by Greg Jefferis.
